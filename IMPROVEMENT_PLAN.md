# 🚀 Improvement Plan — AWS SageMaker + Snowflake ML Pipeline: Financial Fraud Detection

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

✅ Build a **Cloud-Native ML Pipeline** combining:
    - Snowflake for enterprise data storage
    - SageMaker for model training & deployment
    - Python-based ML pipeline (modular, tested, production-ready)

✅ Deliver a **Capstone-level project** demonstrating:
    - Cloud architecture thinking
    - Scalable ML pipeline design
    - Real-world business impact for FinTech & Enterprise AI roles

---

## ✅ Completed Milestones

✅ Modular code structure (src/, notebooks/, tests/)  
✅ Unit tests with Pytest  
✅ GitHub Actions CI pipeline  
✅ SageMaker training pipeline operational  
✅ Secure Snowflake connection  
✅ Inference pipeline writing predictions back to Snowflake  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis notebook started  
✅ README badges + professional structure

## 🚧 In Progress

🚧 Initial SageMaker model results (ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall)  
🚧 Architecture Diagram → `/docs/architecture.png`  
🚧 EDA visualizations → `notebooks/EDA.ipynb`  
🚧 Final polished README → add visual flair

## 🗺️ Next Targets (July Sprint)

☐ Add SageMaker Endpoint for real-time inference  
☐ Add feature importance visualization  
☐ Add dashboard (Streamlit or AWS Quicksight)  
☐ Improve unit test coverage (> 80%)  
☐ Publish Capstone summary on GitHub & LinkedIn
